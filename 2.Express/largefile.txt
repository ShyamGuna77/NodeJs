thread Pool Size: By default, the libuv thread pool in Node.js has 4 threads.
Thread Pool Tasks: Certain I/O-bound operations like reading a file, performing DNS lookups, or crypto tasks are offloaded to these worker threads.
Handling Concurrent Requests: Since the thread pool has a finite number of threads, if there are more tasks than available threads, the tasks will wait in a queue until a thread becomes available. This can cause some performance bottlenecks if you have many blocking tasks.
Modifying Thread Pool Size
You can modify the number of threads in the libuv thread pool by setting the UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE environment variable. For example, to increase the thread pool size to 8:Explanation:

Even though we are reading multiple files concurrently, each fs.readFile call is executed asynchronously.
The blocking I/O tasks are offloaded to the thread pool.
Node.js efficiently manages concurrent tasks using the event loop and thread pool without blocking the main execution.
When to Worry About Thread Pool
While the thread pool is mostly invisible to the developer, there are certain cases where its limitations could impact performance:

Many Blocking Operations: If you perform many blocking I/O operations concurrently, you might exhaust the thread pool and cause delays in task execution.
CPU-Bound Tasks: If your application performs CPU-heavy operations, it's better to offload those tasks to a separate worker thread or use a cluster pattern rather than rely on the thread pool.
Conclusion
The thread pool in Node.js allows non-blocking I/O operations to run asynchronously, ensuring that the main event loop remains unblocked and the application can handle other requests. Understanding how the thread pool works helps you optimize the performance of your Node.js applications, especially when working with blocking tasks like file system access, cryptography, or DNS resolution.
